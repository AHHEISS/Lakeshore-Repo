# Lakeshore-Repo

## Lakeshore Controller temperature, flow and pressure monitoring code

Individual Python scripts converted to .exe programs with accompanying .bat files and desktop shortcut icons for the following:

1.  `Flow.py`            USB Flow Module A & B
2.  `Flow-A--Press-B.py` Flow plus Pressure (not AutoCool or CAMTouch)
3.  `LakeshoreApp-U2.py` LS335 Temperature - two sensors - USB
4.  `LakeshoreApp-U2-Flow.py` LS335 Temperature - two sensors plus flow - USB
5.  `LakeshoreApp-U4.py` LS336 Temperature - four sensors - USB
6.  `LakeshoreApp-U4-Flow.py` LS336 Temperature - four sensors plus flow - USB
7.  `LakeshoreApp-U4-Flow-Press.py` LS336 Temperature - four sensors plus flow plus pressure - USB
8.  `LakeshoreApp-U8-Flow.py` LS336 Temperature - eight sensors plus flow - USB
9.  `LakeshoreApp-U8-Flow-Press.py` LS336 Temperature - eight sensors plus flow plus pressure - USB
10.  `LakeshoreApp-E4.py` LS336 Temperature - four sensors - Ethernet
11.  `LakeshoreApp-E4-Flow.py` LS336 Temperature - four sensors plus flow - Ethernet
12.  `LakeshoreApp-E4-Flow-Press.py` LS336 Temperature - four sensors plus flow plus pressure - Ethernet
13.  `LakeshoreApp-E8-Flow.py` LS336 Temperature - eight sensors plus flow - Ethernet
14.  `LakeshoreApp-E8-Flow-Press.py` LS336 Temperature - eight sensors plus flow plus pressure - Ethernet

The ColdEdge test and R&D lab has eight computers compatible with the Python Lakeshore Application    
Unfortunately all but four have the User Account named differently and the Resilio link variously named and located  
This has required five separate versions of the code to be downloaded to each of the individual computers  
The computers are itemized in the table below and separate directories have been created for each of the five variants

| Computer           | Users Directory  | AnyDesk ID    | Location  | Resilio |
