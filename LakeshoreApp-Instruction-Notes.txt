These modules track two LS335 temperature sensors and one flowmeter
or four or eight LS336 temperature sensors and one flowmeter.
They may also track either two flowmeters
or one flowmeter and one pressure sensor.

They are started directly from the icon on the desktop

1)  Type the correct COM-port number and press "ENTER"

2)  Find/Make the directory for the system under test
    Type that directory name (followed by "\") and the
    file name for this measurement and press "ENTER"

3)  Type any initial comments into the text box
    and press "Save Notes"
    A time-stamped text file is then created with the
    same name "_Notes.txt" and can be opened and edited
    during the measurement.
    Changes can be saved by typing "CTRL-S"


Modules are available for
